The portfolio itself is a single-page website built with HTML, Tailwind, a custom CSS file and JavaScript.

The page contains links to my GitHub Pages and my LinkedIn profile, a mailto link and a link to download my CV.

The projects are displayed as cards with a slideshow of screenshots and information about the main features.

I have added a small script to show a "back to top" button when the user scrolls down the page.

JavaScript also takes care of the photo slideshow.
