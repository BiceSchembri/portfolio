A portfolio showcasing some of my projects.

It was deployed on Github pages: you can view it [here](https://biceschembri.github.io/portfolio/).

## Portfolio Page

![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

The portfolio itself is a single-page website built with HTML, Tailwind, some custom CSS and JavaScript.

The page contains links to my **Github Pages** and my **LinkedIn profile**, a `mailto` link and a link to download my CV.

The projects are displayed as cards with a cover image and information about the main features. The cards are created dynamically with JavaScript from an array of objects.

I have added a small script to show a "back to top" button when the user scrolls down the page.
